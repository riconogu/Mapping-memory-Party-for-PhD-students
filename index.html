    <h3><center>Mapping the PARTY FOR MSU PHD STUDENTS</center></h3>
    <p><left>Friendship is a virtue ... most necessary with a view to living. For without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods; even rich men and those in possession of office and of dominating power are thought to need friends most of all ... For with friends men are most able both to think and to act. Aristotle</left></p>
    <p><left>Although by now we can conclude that Marx’s dream of a socialist state didn’t work out, it is impressive how the product of a drunken mind had such a huge impact on the world. Meaning that drunks can absolutely make a difference. Micky Bumbar</left></p>

Unlike some of the bars near the MSU Campus, the Peanut Barrel is not attracting vast amounts of undergraduate students, or if it does, it is not that obvious. Some graduate students will appreciate that for reasons that could need an ethnographic analysis. The place can be loud sometimes, but it will never be so loud you think you are having a wild and amazing time with drunken friends. Both your peers and the Bar's personnel may expect decency and some degree of propriety of you.</p><p><img src='https://wp.usatodaysports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2018/05/images-22.jpg' alt='Peanut Barrel' width='192' height='150'></p><p></p>");

It has incredible discounts, and the quality of their products is great. But do not expect a quiet conversation about capitalism's principles or the political turmoils in Venezuela while you are hanging at Harper's. Things will get out of hand, and you may end up knowing more than you want of your peers and numerous vicinity. First of all, Harper's has a dance floor, so things may get awkward with your peers if they decide to go there and try it. Harper's also attracts hundreds of undergraduate students, especially on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Consequently, some of your students or lab assistants may end up watching you trying to catch the rhythm with your intellectual body movements. Finally, thanks to recent world events and some degree of administrative and collective carelessness, you and your peers may end up knowing more than you want about the kind of viruses some people were hosting in their bodies. No guarantees here, but high stakes can produce high gains!</p><p><img src='https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/06/28/PLSJ/3c30021e-4b51-4dbd-84f1-53c3d1c57666-harpers-1.jpg?crop=2399,1350,x0,y161&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp' alt='Harper's Restaurant & Brew Pub' width='300' height='150'></p><p></p>");

You can also expect to have productive conversations about your next research project with your peers. As long as you can have that kind of talk in a sometimes lousy environment, you will be fine.  But Dublin is a place with a hidden door that can be easily mistaken for the Leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the Rainbow. Party will be wild behind that door, and you could try to know a little bit more about your peers advancing into that uncharted territory with the help of a couple of Tequila shots. Once there, you should know you will face undergraduate students and a dancefloor. By the end of the night, the Tequilas in your head will remind you of all those good things you were not expecting from your peer. </p><p><img src='https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/_M_NetqWcvolq_Ipo4zjTAJZhS1d2_fLmHGj-yWMmLX8wPBNusiD8MBU6QHLhUY15B-ileoFjrisVr2-67mS97wBmKDpRQiNUd4' alt='Dublin Square Irish Pub Restaurant' width='300' height='150'></p><p></p>");

Located in Lansing, The Avenue does not attract a lot of undergraduate students into its dark interior. Tens of pinball machines offer something to do while reflecting on the arguments a peer gave you to consider how misguided your dissertation project actually is. There are two pool tables to show off, and some arcades as well. If they are on their lucky day, people coming to The Avenue may end up watching a queer country music band animating the closeted socialists to come out. When you can find that kind of things in a single place, you should not expect less of the sort of things you will find in your peers. If it is true your dissertation project is a little misguided, it is also true you have a good graduate student friend drinking that loaded beer right beside you.</p><p><img src='https://www.nationalrockreview.com/wp-content/gallery/dagon-avenuecafe-lansing-mi-20161021-chuckmarshall/dagon-avenuecafe-lansing-mi-20161021-chuckmarshall-011.jpg' alt='The Avenue' width='300' height='150'></p><p></p>");

The music is good, and when the night is right, the party will be as hard as you need it to watch your American peers throwing their forbidden dance moves. You will also find unique and caring employees who will no doubt one second to kick you out if you get a little drunk. Drunkness and The Green Door don´t fit together, but some testimonies suggest harassment of women on The Green Door can happen sometimes. Hopefully, you won´t have to encounter the random display of sexism, and you will get a night to remember as well as a stronger bond with your peers.  </p><p><img src='https://assets.simpleviewinc.com/simpleview/image/upload/crm/lansing/p558b_3234464c-cec0-c437-dbf4c27e4220ffbf.jpg' alt='The Green Door Bar & Grill' width='300' height='150'></p><p></p>");
